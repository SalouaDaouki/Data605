lu_decomposition <- function(A) {
  n <- nrow(A)
  
  # Initialize matrices L and U
  L <- matrix(0, n, n)
  U <- matrix(0, n, n)
  
  # LU decomposition algorithm
  for (k in 1:(n-1)) {
    # U matrix
    for (j in (k+1):n) {
      U[k, j] <- A[k, j] - sum(L[k, 1:(k-1)] * U[1:(k-1), j])
    }
    
    # L matrix
    for (i in k:n) {
      L[i, k] <- (A[i, k] - sum(L[i, 1:(k-1)] * U[1:(k-1), k])) / U[k, k]
    }
  }
  
  # Set diagonal elements of L to 1
  for (i in 1:n) {
    L[i, i] <- 1
  }
  
  # Return the factorized matrices L and U
  return(list(L = L, U = U))
}

# Apply the function on a 3x3 matrix
A <- matrix(c(2, -1, -2, -4, 6, 3, -4, -1, 8), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
lu_factorization <- lu_decomposition(A)
L <- lu_factorization$L
U <- lu_factorization$U
# Display the original matrix and the result matrices
print(A)
print(L)
print(U)


```

I solved the matrix factorization LU for the above matrix and I found the result showed in the image below:

![LU factorization of matrix A](IMG_0360.jpg){width="371"}

I think there is something with my function that I cannot figure out that makes the elements on either L or U matrix to be inf or -inf and I checked the matrix and I found that is not singular:

```{r}
Det_A <- det(A)
print(Det_A)
```
